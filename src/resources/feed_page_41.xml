<p>RICHARD E. JENNINGS was born in Hampstead, England (20 May 1921 – 19 January 1997) was a British comic book artist who lived and worked in the United Kingdom.<br />
Died 19 January 1997 in Cornwall, England.</p>
<p>Richard E. Jennings was born in Hampstead, England. In 1937 he won a free place to the Central School of Arts, London. After 2 years his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War, during which he served in the Air/Sea Rescue service of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East. Following demobilisation he travelled around England before taking work as a fisherman, and decorating public houses and hotels in the Devon area for a brewery company.</p>
<p>Moving to London in 1950, he secured a position with the newly launched Eagle comic. His first work was on the Tommy Walls strip (advertising Wall’s ice cream). He worked on this for the next three years, eventually writing the scripts as well as providing the artwork.</p>
<p>In October 1953 Jennings commenced work as the artist on the new Eagle Storm Nelson maritime adventure strip, in collaboration with film screenwriter Guy Morgan. After Morgan left he continued both drawing and writing the strip until its cancellation in March 1962. Further work for the Eagle followed during that year, with his last strip for the comic being &#8216;Island of Fire&#8217; which ran from July to October 1962.</p>
<p>Jennings&#8217; work was not confined to the Eagle. Other commissions included strips for the Junior Mirror, Swift and early episodes of The Daleks comic strip for TV Century 21. He also provided artwork for several annuals.</p>
<p>By the late 1960s Jennings had ceased working as a comic strip artist. At one point he was employed as a long-distance lorry driver, supplementing his income by travelling around the Yorkshire Dales during his spare time painting pub signs and portraits.</p>
<p>In later years Jennings retired to Cornwall. He died of pneumonia on 19 January 1997, aged 75.</p>
<p>His Comic works include &#8211;</p>

<p>Peter Charles Geoffrey Jackson (4 March 1922, in Brighton – 2 May 2003, in Northwood, London) was a British artist who is noted for his cartoon strip &#8216;London is Stranger Than Fiction&#8217; that ran every Wednesday in the London Evening News newspaper. The strip featured quirky and little known historical facts about London in an easy to read illustrated cartoon strip. The strip ran continuously from 1949 until the paper closed for good in 1980.<br />
Peter Jackson&#8217;s London Is Stranger Than Fiction strip which appeared on 10 August 1949</p>
<p>Jackson showed a talent for illustration from childhood. He attended Hove High School and then Willesden School of Art. He submitted some sketches to the newspaper unsolicited in 1949 and through a lucky coincidence the paper was looking for an artist to do a strip about London at that time. He was hired and the strip become a success, giving rise to books of compilations of his work.[2]</p>
<p>He also authored the &#8220;Saul of Tarsus&#8221; cartoon, which appeared in the first issues of the Eagle comic and reflected Jackson&#8217;s religious faith. His work also appeared in the children&#8217;s educational comics Look and Learn and Treasure .</p>
<p>Jackson also became a notable collector of antiques and documents relating to the history of London. The Ephemera Society, presented Jackson with the Samuel Pepys Medal for his contribution to ephemera studies.</p>
<p>He married Valerie Harris in 1995.</p>

<p>(28 January 1874 &#8211; 15 March 1948, UK)</p>
<p>Mary Tourtel was the creator of &#8216;Rupert Bear&#8217;, the famous newspaper comic of the Daily Express. Born in Kent, she was already an illustrator of children&#8217;s books when she was asked to create a character for the Daily Express. Although she was wife of the Express newspaper&#8217;s night news editor, Herbert Tourtel, it wasn&#8217;t simply a case of nepotism. When all attempts to find an animal character that would enable the Express to counter its Fleet Street rivals had failed, she came to the rescue with the furry bear.<br />
A trained artist, particularly skilled in the depiction of animals, she wrote and drew many &#8216;Rupert&#8217; stories between 1920 and 1935, introducing such memorable new characters as Podgy Pig and Bill Badger. Failing eyesight forced her to leave the artwork of the strip to Alfred Bestall, but she remained involved in the strip&#8217;s creation until her death in 1948.</p>

<p>MALCOLM JUDGE (1918 – 17 January 1989) was a British cartoonist, best known for his contributions to DC Thomson&#8217;s range of comics. He was married, had one daughter, and lived in Bishopbriggs near Glasgow.</p>
<p>His early career was spent as a writer and journalist, and in 1948 he began contributing comic strips to the newspapers and magazines at DC Thomson. He contributed his first strip, The Badd Ladds to The Beezer in 1960, and Colonel Crackpot&#8217;s Circus to The Beano the same year. He created several more popular strips including The Numskulls in the Beezer in 1962, Billy Whizz in The Beano, a.k.a. the greatest comic in the world, in 1964 and Ball Boy in the same comic in 1975. He also drew Square Eyes for The Topper, and Ali&#8217;s Baba and Baron Von Reichs-Pudding in Sparky before and after its merge with the Topper.</p>
<p>Judge remained an active contributor to DC Thomson until his death at the age of 70 in early 1989. John Dallas took over Ball Boy, and John Geering replaced Judge on The Badd Ladds, while the workload on Billy Whizz was shared by Barrie Appleby and Steve Horrocks until the appointment of long-term successor David Parkins. The numskulls had already been taken over by Tom Lavery in 1979 .</p>

<p>(b. 1947, UK)</p>
<p>John Harrold was a longtime artist of the comic adventures of the bear &#8216;Rupert&#8217; for the Daily Express. He was born in 1947 in Glasgow, where he also studied painting and drawing at the local School of Art. He made his first drawings starring &#8216;Rupert&#8217; in 1973 for &#8216;Lots of Fun to Cook with Rupert&#8217;. The Daily Express subsequently assigned him for the newspaper strips, where he succeeded Alfred Bestall and Alex Cubie.
