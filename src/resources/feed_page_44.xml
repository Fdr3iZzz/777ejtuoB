<p>RON TURNER&#8217;s artwork emerged in the independent comic books of 1949. His first color work, like &#8216;Giants of the Second World&#8217; and &#8216;Terror of Titan&#8217;, appeared in Tit-Bits Science Fiction Comix in 1953. That same year, he was offered a regular commission on a self-penned strip called &#8216;Space Ace&#8217;, published in the monthly Lone Star comic book. &#8216;Rick Random, Space Detective&#8217; followed a year later.</p>
<p>When the Tit-Bits series closed, Turner moved to the Amalgamated Press and drew many stories for their &#8216;Library&#8217; series. In 1969, after illustrating television sci-fi series, Turner did &#8216;The Space Accident&#8217; and &#8216;Wonder Car&#8217; for Whizzer &amp; Chips. He then returned to more adult strips like &#8216;Judge Dredd&#8217; and &#8216;Spinball&#8217; and in 1985, Turner took on his fabled rival Frank Hampson and revived &#8216;Dan Dare&#8217; for the new series of Eagle. Ron Turner died at the age of 76 on 19 December 1998.</p>

<p>ROBERT NIXON: Long associated with the Beano, the British children&#8217;s comics illustrator and cartoonist Robert Nixon has died, aged 63. During his lengthy career, he drew Roger the Dodger and many more of D.C . Thomson&#8217;s famous characters, as well as contributing for 12 years to the weekly comics of rival publishers IPC. His editor at the Beano said that Nixon would have been able to illustrate a note to the milkman and &#8220;make it look appealing&#8221;.</p>
<p>Nixon was born in Southbank, near Middlesbrough, where his father worked in the steel industry. One of six children, he was educated at the Central secondary modern school in Southbank, where his artistic talents were recognised early. He won several art competitions and a scholarship to Middlesbrough Art College, but he was forced to leave because of his father&#8217;s death.</p>
<p>In 1955 he got a job in the art department at a printing factory, where he served an apprenticeship as a lithographic artist. He started submitting work to the Beano in 1964 and had his first set of pictures published in April that year in an episode of Little Plum, Your Redskin Chum, first drawn by Leo Baxendale.</p>
<p>Later that year, following the departure of the original artist, Ken Reid, Nixon took over Roger the Dodger. By 1965 he had enough assignments to go freelance full time. Nixon proved especially skilled at &#8220;ghosting&#8221; various styles, while adding his own distinctive cuteness. He inherited Lord Snooty and His Pals in 1968 from Dudley Watkins and revived Grandpa in 1971, as well as drawing Esky Mo and Captain Cutler for Sparky.</p>
<p>In late 1972, he left Thomson&#8217;s to join IPC. Nixon proved invaluable, taking over successful series and originating bizarre characters of his own. He enjoyed drawing mildly macabre horror humour, an IPC speciality inspired by the Addams Family and the Munsters television shows, in new titles like Monster Fun and Shiver and Shake. Nixon continued such regulars as Hire A Horror, about a mad monster agency, and the bolt-necked buffoon Frankie Stein.</p>
<p>Other fondly remembered series include his lavish medieval romp King Arthur and His Frights of the Round Table, which helped launch the comic Whoopee in 1974, and the surreal eco-comedy Family Trees, about a gang of trees always on the run from humans.</p>
<p>Shortly after Euan Kerr became editor of the Beano in November 1984, he persuaded Nixon to return to the comic &#8211; and to Roger the Dodger &#8211; in January 1985. On May 4th, 1985, Nixon created the look of the &#8220;enfant terrible&#8221; Ivy the Terrible, his favourite character. In the 1990s, he also drew Korky the Cat in the Dandy and illustrated merchandise from jigsaw puzzles to Easter egg boxes.</p>
<p>Nixon also drew the newspaper strips, The Gems, about a gang of children (from 1977) and Parkie the park keeper (from 1982) in the Middlesbrough Evening Gazette.</p>
<p>For his own pleasure, he painted in oils, watercolours and pastels. He is survived by his wife Rita, and children Paul, Tony, Wendy and Catherine.</p>
<p>Robert Nixon:born July 7th 1939; died October 22nd 2002</p>

<p>REGINALD EDWARD PARLETT (2 August 1904 – 18 November 1991) was an artist from England who had a career of drawing for comic books that lasted for 66 years.<br />
Born in London, his father Harry Parlett (1881–1971) was also a prolific artist whose work appeared in many publications, often anonymously, as well as on many picture postcards, which he signed as &#8216;Comicus&#8217;. Reg Parlett&#8217;s older brother George (1902–1981) also later became an artist. On leaving school Parlett became a clerk at Thomas Cook.<br />
Realising that he was ill-suited to working for a travel agent, he was encouraged to draw by his father, who submitted his son&#8217;s cartoons to Amalgamated Press (AP); such was his success that he left Thomas Cook and in 1923 became a permanent member of staff for AP. His work appeared in the Merry and Bright comic in 1926, and he would later go on to do comic strips for comics such as Funny Wonder, Radio Fun, Film Fun, Knockout, Buster, Whizzer and Chips, Cor!!, Whoopee!, &#8221;Jackpot and Wow!. He became one of the top artists for Amalgamated Press in the second half of the 1930s, and stayed with the company until his death in 1991.</p>
<p>Parlett served in the R.A.F. during World War II drawing maps, and in the late 1940s he became a writer and artist for J. Arthur Rank&#8217;s GB Animation &#8216;Animaland&#8217; cartoons. He contributed to the 1954 animated film Animal Farm. In the 1960s Parlett worked on his first newspaper strip, when he took over &#8216;Just Jake&#8217; in the Daily Mirror.</p>
<p>On the death of Frank Minnitt in 1958 he became one of the artists who took over the drawing of the Billy Bunter comic strip in Knockout. Such was his popularity that the 2 August 1984 issue of Buster celebrated his 80th birthday, and a 1989 issue of Big Comic Fortnightly celebrated his 85th.<br />
Parlett married in 1928, and with his wife Mary (née Carter), whom he had first met at a dance in 1921, had two sons, Malcolm and Grahame Parlett.<br />
A book titled The Comic Art of Reg Parlett (ISBN 0-9511214-0-5) written by Alan Clark was released on 10 November 1986.</p>

<p>MIKE WHITE was a British comic artist known principally for his work on various IPC/Fleetway and DC Thomson titles.<br />
Mike White began submitting work to comics publishers in the early 1960s, and his earliest work was for Micron&#8217;s romance titles in 1963-64.<br />
He moved to London and His first regular strip was drawing &#8220;Jackaroo Joe&#8221;, (about the adventures of a &#8216;swagman&#8217; in the Australian outback) for Valiant in 1965, written by Angus Allan, for Valiant in 1965-66 and ghosting for Mike Western on &#8220;School for Spacemen&#8221; for Champion. Other strips he drew included &#8220;The Lords of Lilliput Island&#8221;, &#8220;Cannonball Craig&#8221; for Score &#8216;n&#8217; Roar, &#8220;The Team Terry Kept in a Box&#8221; (1973-4, written by Frank S. Pepper) for Lion, &#8220;Whiz-Along Wheeler&#8221; and &#8220;The Test Match Terrors&#8221;.<br />
For Action in 1976 he drew &#8220;The Running Man&#8221;, &#8220;Hell&#8217;s Highway&#8221;, &#8220;Kids Rule OK!&#8221; The notorious Kids Rule OK strip (pictured) which led to the suspension of Action due to its violent content and &#8220;Hellman of Hammer Force&#8221;. He drew a number of &#8220;Future Shocks&#8221; and &#8220;Time Twisters&#8221;, including &#8220;The Reversible Man&#8221; and several Abelard Snazz stories written by Alan Moore, as well as &#8220;Distaster 1990&#8221; (1979) and &#8220;The Mean Arena&#8221; (1981-82), written by Tom Tully, for 2000 AD. Again with Tully, he worked on &#8220;Sintek&#8221; (1982-84) for Tiger, and drew &#8220;Wagner&#8217;s Walk&#8221; (1979) for Tornado, &#8220;Starhawk&#8221; (1979-80) for The Crunch, &#8220;Iron Barr&#8221; (1983-84) for Spike, &#8220;Deep Sea Danny&#8217;s Iron Fish&#8221; and &#8220;Raoul the Warrior&#8221; for Buddy, and &#8220;We Are United&#8221; for Champ.</p>
<p>After that he more or less specialised in football strips, drawing &#8220;Dexter&#8217;s Dozen&#8221; (1985-86), &#8220;Cheat&#8221; (1992-93) and &#8220;Dream Keeper&#8221; (1993) for Roy of the Rovers, as well as drawing the lead strip from 1986 to 1992. As boys&#8217; adventure comics declined, he moved into illustration, notably a series of historical educational books, but still contributed to Sonic the Comic and DC Thomson&#8217;s Football Picture Story Monthly and Commando digests, his last story for the latter appearing in March 2011. In his last years his arthritis was so bad he had to hold his drawing hand in his other hand.<br />
Mike White passed away in February 2012 after a long illness.</p>

<p>Widely regarded as one of the best artists to ever grace the British comic industry,<br />
MIKE WESTERN, began his career on Knockout, having already spent time working for GB Animation.</p>
<p>During the fifties he shared art chores with Eric Bradbury on the popular western strip Lucky Logan.</p>
<p>In 1960 he moved onto TV Express where he drew No Hiding Place and Biggles.</p>
<p>Buster and Valiant followed and Mike found himself drawing long-running strips such as Wild Wonders.</p>
<p>In the seventies he had been even more prolific, illustrating Buster’s The Leopard from Lime Street, and the gritty Battle stories Darkie’s Mob and HMS Nightshade.</p>
