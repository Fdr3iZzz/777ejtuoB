<p>(1930 &#8211; January 2005, Scotland)</p>
<p>Jim Turnbull was a Scottish cartoonist, who work appeared in the Glasgow newspaper The Herald for many years. Prior to this, he had been a funny animal comics artist for the nursery titles of the Amalgamated Press/Fleetway Publications and DC Thomson. When related to his comics work, he is generally (and erroneously?) referred to as &#8220;Douglas Turnbull&#8221;.<br />
James Turnbull was born in 1930 in Maryhill, Glasgow, as the son of a railway worker. The family later moved to Pollokshields where he attended Albert Road school. He took evening classes at Glasgow and Guildford Shools of Art, where he was trained as a lithographic artist. He served part of his national service in Suez. He possibly joined the Amalgamated Press in the late 1950s, and stayed with the company after it became Fleetway Publications during the early 1960s. Since British comics artists were scarcely allowed to sign their work, and generally asked to copy another artist&#8217;s style or a housestyle, it is still difficult to pinpoint exact credits.</p>
<p>Turnbull was one of the artists drawing the adventures of &#8216;Freddie Frog&#8217; in Jack &amp; Jill, when the original artist Peter Woolcock took a break from it in the early 1960s. Other artists involved with the feature were Gordon Hutchings and the Italians Antonio Lupatelli and Sergio Asteriti. In Playhour, Turnbull drew stories based on the TV show about the two pigs &#8216;Pinky &amp; Perky&#8217;. He was also one of the artists of Playhour&#8217;s &#8216;The Merry Tales of Mimi and Marny&#8217;, another featured originated by Woolcock. Turnbull later appeared in the nursery titles of competitor DC Thomson, such as Bimbo and Magic. He was the artist of the series &#8216;Old McDonald&#8217;s Farm&#8217; (Bimbo, 1964), and one of the artists drawing &#8216;Cuddly and Dudley&#8217; (Magic, 1970s). The latter was a spin-off starring the niece and nephew of The Dandy&#8217;s &#8216;Biffo the Bear&#8217;, drawn by Dudley D. Watkins.</p>
<p>He started his career as a daily newspaper caricaturist with the Daily Record in the mid 1960s. He did his first contribution to the Glasgow Herald in 1969 and stayed with this newspaper over 30 years. He drew both humorous and political cartoons for this newspaper. Typical for his work was his depiction of Scotland as a &#8220;feart lion&#8221;, with a nod to the Cowardly Lion from Frank L. Baum&#8217;s novel &#8216;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&#8217;. Following the abortive 1979 referendum for a proposed legislature for Scotland, the artist felt his country was like a scabrous lion in a cage with an open door. In the 1990s he made the illustrations for Charlie Allan&#8217;s &#8216;Farmer&#8217;s Diary&#8217; book series (Ardo Publishing Co Ltd). He was also an avid painter, making many works during his travels to Italy. Jim Turnbull passed away in January 2005 at the age of 74.</p>

<p>J. F. Sullivan (1852-1936)</p>
<p>&#8220;The British Working-Man&#8221; from Fun</p>
<p>James Frank Sullivan was born on 31 October 1852 at Great Ormond Street, London, the son of printer and stationer James Sullivan and his wife Harriett, née Crosbie. He studied at the National Art Training School in South Kensington, where he learned to draw the figure from classical sculpture, and then took a studio, where he drew live models.</p>
<p>At the age of 18 he was invited to contribute to the comic journal Fun, a cheaper, liberal rival to Punch. He became the magazine&#8217;s leading cartoonist, and pioneered the strip cartoon, including a series of cartoons entitled &#8220;The British Working-Man&#8221;, which started in 1875 and ran untilo 1901, satirising tradesmen, retailers and their customers, commuters, industrialists, landowners, journalists and politicians. He advocated the presence of women in parliament, was sceptical of British imperialism, and deplored what he called &#8220;grandmotherly government&#8221;, today known as the &#8220;nanny state&#8221;.</p>
<p>He also drew for Black-and-White, Cassell&#8217;s, Pearson&#8217;s, Pick-Me-Up, The Strand Magazine (a feature called &#8220;The Queer Side of Things&#8221;), Tom Hood&#8217;s Comic Annual, and, for two brief periods in 1893 and 1905, Punch. He illustrated Marie Corelli&#8217;s novels The Sorrows of Satan (1895) and Belial&#8217;s Burdens (1896), and wrote and illustrated books for children.</p>
<p>He retired in 1904, settling in Chertsey and pursuing interests including metalwork, illuminated manuscripts, wood-carving and heraldry. He died there on 5 May 1936, aged 83, survived by his wife Agnes, née Mullett, whom he had married in 1877.</p>

<p>IAN KENNEDY (born 22 September 1932, Dundee, Scotland) is a UK artist who worked initially for D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd, then later for Amalgamated Press</p>
<p>Educated at the Clepington Primary School and then at Morgan Academy, both in Dundee, Kennedy was employed after leaving school by D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. He was taken on as a trainee illustrator in their Art Department in 1949. He recalls that his first published work was inking the black squares in the weekly Sunday Post crossword.</p>
<p>In 1953 having become married, Kennedy managed to get work in Amalgamated Press&#8217;s Knockout via a local agent. In 1955 he began working for D. C. Thomson again, this time as a freelance artist.</p>
<p>During the 1950s Kennedy mainly illustrated war comics such as Thriller Picture Library and Air Ace and his work appeared in a range of comics including Hotspur, Buster, and Wizard.</p>
<p>From the 1970s onward, Kennedy began to specialise in science fiction comics, regularly producing work for IPC&#8217;s 2000AD and Star Lord. He also worked for Battle Picture Weekly, Buddy, Blake&#8217;s 7, Eagle (Dan Dare), M.A.S.K., Victor Summer Special, Wildcat and D. C. Thomson&#8217;s pocket books (including Commando).</p>
<p>Kennedy has also over the years produced many covers for different comics and annuals, working mainly in acrylic paint. In the late 1980s and 1990s Kennedy began creating the covers for the annual RAF Leuchars Air Show&#8217;s programmes.</p>
<p>He went into semi-retirement in 1997.</p>
<p>As of 2016, he continues to draw covers and features for Commando.</p>
<p>A definitive career-spanning interview with Kennedy appears in the Spring 2009 edition (Vol.11, No.1) of the &#8220;International Journal of Comic Art&#8221;</p>

<p>(21 December 1918 &#8211; 8 July 1985, UK)</p>
<p>Frank Hampson was only thirteen when he got an assignment to draw sketches for Meccano Magazine. At the age of twenty, he started studying at the Victoria College of Arts &amp; Sciences. During World War II, he served in the Royal Army Service Corps and became a lieutenant. At the end of the war, freshly married, he started attending the Southport School of Arts and Crafts and tried to make a living doing freelance jobs. He met Marcus Morris, a vicar, who had ambitions for founding a national Christian magazine, The Anvil, with a special emphasis on material for youngsters.<br />
Eventually, Morris employed Hampson full-time, and they created Eagle, the magazine that featured the popular &#8216;Dan Dare&#8217; comics, 1950. Hampson started out doing all the work single-handedly, but soon gathered a large crew of hard-working artists around him, including artists Desmond Walduck, Harold Johns, and Donald Harley, as well as writers Alan Stranks and Arthur C. Clarke. The years between 1955 and 1959 were the heyday of the Eagle studios. In addition to &#8216;Dan Dare&#8217;, Hampson has worked on a variety of other strips for Eagle, such as &#8216;The Great Adventurer&#8217;, &#8216;Tommy Walls&#8217;, &#8216;Rob Conway&#8217; and &#8216;The Road of courage&#8217;. After this, with a new editor, Frank retired from the &#8216;Dan Dare&#8217; strip, leaving it to Frank Bellamy. In 1975, he was given an award recognizing his work at the Comic Festival in Lucca. He died of a stroke in 1985.</p>

<p>DONALD SOUTHAM LAWRENCE (17 November 1928 – 29 December 2003) was a British comic book artist and author.</p>
<p>Lawrence is best known for his comic strips The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire in the British weeklies Ranger and Look and Learn and the Storm series, first published in the Dutch weekly Eppo (later relaunched as Sjors &amp; Sjimmie) and subsequently in album form. Famous for his realistic and detailed style, he was an inspiration for later UK comic-book artists such as Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons and Chris Weston (indeed, Weston was taught by Lawrence), and influenced Indonesian artist Apri Kusbiantoro.</p>
<p>Early life</p>
<p>Born in East Sheen, a suburb of London, Lawrence was educated at St. Paul&#8217;s School, Hammersmith. After joining the Army for his National Service, Lawrence used his gratuity to study art at Borough Polytechnic Institute (now the London South Bank University) but failed his final exams. Shortly before, a former student had visited the school to show students the work he was doing as a letterer on comic strips. Lawrence was inspired to take some samples to an editor at Amalgamated Press who suggested he try showing them to Mick Anglo, who ran a studio packaging comic strips for a London publisher and magazine distributor, Len Miller.</p>
<p>Lawrence worked for Anglo for four years, drawing the adventures of superhero Marvelman and various Western comic strips. After an argument with Anglo over pay rates, he found work with Odhams Press, drawing Wells Fargo for Zip, and with the Amalgamated Press (now renamed Fleetway Publications), contributing episodes of Billy the Kid to the comic Sun. When the ailing Sun merged with Lion, Lawrence switched to swashbuckling historical strips, Olac the Gladiator, Karl the Viking and Maroc the Mighty (written by Michael Moorcock).</p>
<p>A colour strip produced for Lion Annual 1965 (&#8216;Karl the Viking and the Tideless Sea&#8217;) led to Lawrence being offered colour work in Bible Story magazine and the sprawling science fantasy The Rise and Fall of the Trigan Empire which debuted in Ranger in 1965. Lawrence was to draw the strip in the pages of Ranger and Look and Learn until 1976.</p>
<p>In 1976 Lawrence attended the London comic book convention called Comics 101, the first convention dedicated to British comic book creators. There he learned that The Trigan Empire was syndicated all over Europe. When his publisher refused to give him any form of royalties or compensation, he departed from his old employer and was immediately offered work on a new Dutch comic called Eppo. After an abortive start on a strip entitled Commander Grek written by his friend Vince Wernham, Lawrence found success with Storm. The first volume, The Deep World, was based on a concept by Martin Lodewijk but written by Philip Dunn. A further 22 volumes followed.</p>
<p>Lawrence did not limit himself solely to Trigan Empire and Storm and other strips he drew include Fireball XL5 and The Adventures of Tarzan for TV Century 21, Carrie for the men&#8217;s magazine Mayfair and a number of one-off strips for various Dutch publishers.</p>
<p>A number of partly completed and unpublished comic strips appeared in the series Don Lawrence Collection, published in the Netherlands. The final Storm serial (completed by Lawrence&#8217;s former assistant Liam Sharp appeared in the magazine Pandarve published by the Don Lawrence Fanclub in 1999–2001. One of his last illustrations was the cover of volume 6 of the Storm -the collection- from 2002.</p>
<p>In the mid 80s he was looking for an assistant and accepted then 17-years old Liam Sharp as his apprentice, but after realizing he did not want to step back as much as he had though he would, he helped Sharp develop his own style.</p>
<p>Later life</p>
<p>In 1995, he lost sight of his right eye, caused by an infection after an unsuccessful cataract operation. With his depth perception gone, he could no longer see when the tip of his pen and brush touched the paper&#8217;s surface, forcing him to teach himself an alternative drawing technique.</p>
<p>He went through a new cataract operation in 1999, this time without medical complications. But his general health was starting to decline, and when he was diagnosed with emphysema and put on medication, he permanently retired from comics and art.</p>
<p>Lawrence died in December 2003 of emphysema at the age of 75.</p>

<p>BRIAN MONCRIEFF LEWIS (3 June 1929 – 4 December 1978) was a British science fiction illustrator, comics artist and animator.</p>
<p>Lewis served in the RAF, and became involved in science fiction fandom in the early 1950s. His first professional illustration was for the Radio Times, and he began contributing to New Worlds in 1954, painting forty covers for the magazine. He also painted 21 covers for Science Fantasy, 19 for Science Fiction Adventures and a few for Digit Books between 1957 and 1962. His work was characterised by strong colours laid on thickly, and was influenced by surrealists Paul Klee and Max Ernst and illustrator Richard Powers.</p>
<p>His first work in comics was the strip &#8220;Magna Carta&#8221; for Lone Star in 1959. In the early 1960s he drew adventure strips &#8220;Jet Ace Logan&#8221;, &#8220;The Suicide Six&#8221;, &#8220;Paddy Ryan&#8221;, &#8220;Memorable Moments in Sport&#8221; and &#8220;The Destroyer from the Depths&#8221; for Tiger, &#8220;Captain Condor&#8221; for Lion, &#8220;John Brody&#8221; and &#8220;Brett Million&#8221; for Boys&#8217; World, &#8220;Planet Z&#8221; for Hurricane, and &#8220;The Guinea Pig&#8221; and &#8220;Mann of Battle&#8221; for Eagle. He also used a more cartoony style to draw &#8220;Pest of the West&#8221; and &#8220;Georgie&#8217;s Germs&#8221; in Wham!, and &#8220;Space Jinx&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie&#8217;s Choice&#8221; for Smash.</p>
<p>Around 1966 he moved into animation, working on films such as Yellow Submarine. In the late 1960s and 70s he drew TV adaptations for TV21, Countdown and TV Action, and horror adaptations for Dez Skinn&#8217;s House of Hammer, which led to a strip, written by Cary Bates, for Warren Publishing&#8217;s Vampirella in the USA. He also continued his cartoonier work with &#8220;Tomboy&#8221; in Cor!! and Buster and &#8220;Les Dawson is Superflop&#8221; in Look-in. In 1978 he had a brief stint on &#8220;Dan Dare&#8221; in 2000 AD, drew a strip in a Van Der Valk annual, and produced some technical illustrations for Harry Harrison&#8217;s book Mechanismo. He died on 4 December 1978. His final published work appeared in The Wall of Years by Andrew M. Stephenson in 1979.</p>

<p>(14 December 1892, Upper Burma &#8211; 15 January 1986, UK)</p>
<p>Alfred Bestall is a British illustrator of children&#8217;s books and Amalgamated Press annuals. Born in Mandalay, Burma, as the son of a Methodist Missionary, Bestall eventually was sent to Rydal Public School in North Wales. He attended the Birmingham Central School of Art and spent three years in Flanders during his military service in World War I. He contributed his first cartoons to The Cartoon and Blighty and worked through the Byron Studios in London after the war.</p>
<p>He drew for Punch and was also present in magazines like Passing Show, Tatler, Eve and The Strand. He became a productive book illustrator and also drew for the Schoolgirl&#8217;s Own Annual by Amalgamated Press between 1923 and 1942. He was the artist who continued the adventures of &#8216;Rupert Bear&#8217; when creator Mary Tourtel quit the series.</p>
<p>Bestall started in 1935, when the furry British bear Rupert already had fifteen years in the public eye. Bestall managed to increase the popularity of Rupert Bear, who is now known all over the world. He semi-retired in 1965 and &#8216;Rupert&#8217; was continued by Alex Cubie and John Harrold and scriptwriters Freddie Chaplain and James Henderson. Bestall continued to do art on the annuals until 1973, however.</p>

<p>(1 August 1911 &#8211; 1995, UK)</p>
<p>Alex Cubie was a Scottish animator, illustrator and comics artist. He is best known as one of the main artists to draw Mary Tourtel&#8217;s iconic &#8216;Rupert Bear&#8217; newspaper strip during the 1960s and 1970s.<br />
Alex Cubie was born in 1911 in Renfrew, Scotland, not far from the capital Glasgow. He started out drawing cartoons for the newspaper Glasgow Evening Citizen. In 1934 he moved to London, where he created cartoons for The Daily Sketch and The Leader. When World War Two broke out in 1939, Cubie was drafted in the British army the following year. He originally worked as a fitter, before the army felt his artistic talent could be more useful in their design team, where he could draw lay-outs for tactical exercises. After the war Cubie returned to Fleet Street, where he designed greeting cards.<br />
In the late 1940s Cubie made a move to animation. He joined the Rank film company in Cookham. Around the same time one of Disney&#8217;s animation directors, David Hand, was in England to help out the Gaumont Company with their own locally produced animated films. Cubie became part of Hand&#8217;s British-based animation unit. Cubie was already an illustrator for the quarterly &#8216;Rupert Adventure Series&#8217; books between 1952 and 1962, in alternation with Enid Ash. The heads of Rupert and his friends were sometimes filled in by Alfred Bestall.</p>
<p>In 1951 Cubie became an illustrator and cartoonist for the Daily Express. It wasn&#8217;t until 1965 before he was asked to become one of Alfred Bestall&#8217;s successors on the &#8216;Rupert Bear&#8217; comic strip. Bestall was no longer physically able to continue the series and instantly retired (although he continued to provide artwork for the annuals until well into his 90s). Cubie drew adventures with the little white bear until 1978, with Freddie Chaplain providing the stories. Cubie had a more cartoony approach than Bestall and applied thicker black outlines around the characters. Apart from drawing the daily comic itself, Cubie also provided artwork for the annual &#8216;Rupert&#8217; books between 1974 and 1978. Although Cubie produced most stories in the post-Bestall period, other artists who alternated on the stories were Lucy Matthews and Jenny Kisler. John Harrold also drew stories from 1976 onwards and was appointed as the full-time &#8216;Rupert&#8217; artist in 1985. Alex Cubie passed away in 1995.</p>
