<p>TREVOR METCALFE born May 1939 in Brotton, Yorkshire is a British illustrator and comic book artist. Known for his comic strips in IPC Magazines comics such as Sweet Tooth and Junior Rotter in Whizzer and Chips.</p>
<p>Influences include Leo Baxendale, Reg Parlett and Walt Disney.<br />
Metcalfe became interested in drawing at age eight during a stay in hospital. His main influence being sports cartoonist Tom Webster. He first submitted work to his local newspaper alongside art school mate Robert Nixon. After his National Service he obtained work for DC Thomson drawing his own strip Babes and Bullies for The Dandy Annual.<br />
In Whizzer and Chips he drew for many years his most famous characters Junior Rotter The strip was about a boy called Junior Rotter (or J.R.) who is always scheming up plans which generally fail. The character is loosely based on the character of the same name from the television soap opera Dallas. His sister in the comic strip was called Sue Helen who, in contrast to her brother, was a decent, charming and helpful person. Being chalk-and-cheese characters meant that JR and Sue Helen&#8217;s sibling rivalry extended into all-out conflict.</p>
<p>Sweet Tooth first appearing in January 1973. A &#8220;Whizz-Kid&#8221; in the comic, and about a boy who has a fixation for sweets, continually hounded by Greedy Greg (originally Bully Bloggs), A main feature of the comic was the prominent front tooth that the character always displayed. Though other artists drew strips from time to time, Metcalfe was the main artist throughout.<br />
For The Beano, he understudied Billy Whizz for David Parkins in the early 1990s in his traditional style, and replaced Wayne Thompson on the same character between 2005 and 2007 using a graphics tablet, drawing in a style somewhere between his own and Thompson&#8217;s. He has also briefly took over drawing Bob Nixon&#8217;s strips such as Roger the Dodger and Ivy the Terrible, and drew several Les Pretend strips in 2004-2005. He left DC Thomson in 2007, leaving billy whizz without an artist for two years, until Nick Brennan took over in October 2009. In more recent years he has done more serious illustrations, Work is now in TV licensed tie-in comics and magazines, he has gone entirely digital working with a Wacom tablet at his Apple Mac working on Thomas The Tank Engine art in Adobe Illustrator and coloured in Photoshop. He drew warring brothers strip Growing Paynes for the dandy in the 1990s.<br />
He draws comics in Ronald McDonald &amp; Friends Magazine.<br />
In 2010 he began work on a charity-oriented iPhone game called Cent Hope, marking his first foray into creating graphics for smartphone games.</p>

<p>TOM PATERSON is a Scottish comic artist who drew characters for Fleetway in 1973–1990, and D.C Thomson from 1986-onwards. He lives in Leith, with three kids, and is a Hearts supporter.<br />
Taking stylistic inspiration from Leo Baxendale&#8217;s work on The Bash Street Kids, Paterson&#8217;s talent as a cartoonist was discovered at the age of sixteen by original Dandy editor Albert Barnes, who was impressed with the cartoon samples Paterson had sent to him. Barnes offered the young artist a chance to collaborate with him on a strip called The Dangerous Dumplings (which would later be retooled as The Doyle Family for the Dandy), which was to become the leading strip of a new comic Barnes was developing, but the project was scrapped when Barnes retired and Paterson has hired to work for IPC after leaving school.<br />
He is famous for drawing comics such as:</p>
<p>Fleetway</p>
<p>Grimly Feendish from Shiver and Shake<br />
Buster from Buster comic<br />
Guy Gorilla from Whizzer and Chips<br />
Horace and Doris from Whizzer and Chips<br />

Roger the Dodger<br />
Billy Whizz (Beano annuals 2008 and 2010)<br />
Ivy the Terrible<br />
Ball Boy<br />
Little Larry</p>
<p>Beezer</p>
<p>The Banana Bunch<br />

<p>Beryl the Peril<br />

Fiddle &#8216;o&#8217; Diddle<br />
Freddy the Fearless Fly<br />
Hyde &amp; Shriek<br />
Laughing Planet<br />
Mutant Cow<br />
Rasper</p>
<p>Many of his comic strips feature a single, striped sock standing upright on the ground that appears once in each story that acts as a trademark. He is currently drawing for Viz and his work appeared in Jamie Smart&#8217;s Moose Kid Comics.</p>
<p>Brain Duane</p>
<p>Brain Duane was a comic strip in The Dandy. It was about a nerdy bald inventor whose inventions would always go wrong. It was drawn by Tom Paterson between 1997-2005 before it was taken over by Duncan Scott. The strip disappeared when the comic became Dandy Xtreme. He returned in the 2012 Dandy Annual drawn by Steve Beckett. He was one of the characters featured in the PC game, Beanotown Racing.</p>
<p>Tom Paterson Artwork For Sale</p>
<p>Anybody familiar with British comics will of course know the name Tom Paterson, and would probably recognise his trademark smelly sock.<br />
Tom is currently selling some of the original artwork he produced, which includes everything from front covers of Buster comic to more recent Dennis the Menace strips.<br />
Tom&#8217;s highly detailed pages are a treat to the eye and it often takes multiple reads to spot everything hidden in, and sometimes even outside, the panels.<br />
A black and white page costs between £100 &#8211; £150, or you can grab yourself a full-colour one for £200 &#8211; £225.<br />
All the pages seen here are for sale, and Tom has plenty more, so feel free to enquire about others. You can contact Tom by emailing him at:</p>

He started out in comics at the age of 36, in 1967.<br />
Bave started out drawing for WHAM!, to which he contributed &#8216;Sammy Shrink&#8217;, &#8216;Baby Whamster&#8217;, &#8216;Baby Smasher&#8217;, and &#8216;Grimly Feendish&#8217;. He moved over to Fleetway Publications in 1969, and Bave became a regular in Whizzer and Chips. He was the prime artist of the weekly &#8216;Odd Ball&#8217; comic, that started in 1969 and ran until 2000.</p>
<p>During the 1970s and 1980s, Bave worked many other IPC/Fleetway magazines, like Shiver &amp; Shake (&#8216;The Desert Fox&#8217;), Krazy (&#8216;Scaredy Cat&#8217;), Cor!! (&#8216;The Slimms&#8217;), Cheeky/Whoopee (&#8216;Webster&#8217;, &#8216;Toy Boy&#8217;, &#8216;Calculator Kid&#8217;, &#8216;Blabbermouth&#8217;, &#8216;Willy Worry&#8217;), WOW! (&#8216;Barney&#8217;s Badges&#8217;), Jackpot (&#8216;Richie Wraggs&#8217;, &#8216;Full O&#8217;Beans&#8217;) and Buster (&#8216;Draculass&#8217;, &#8216;Pete&#8217;s Pop-Up Book&#8217;, &#8216;Good Guy&#8217;). He has mainly done his scriptwork in cooperation with his wife, Sheila.<br />

<p>STEVE BELL (b. 26 February 1951) is one of Britain&#8217;s sharpest political cartoonists. His best known work are the satirical comics &#8216;Maggie&#8217;s Farm&#8217; (1979) and the more long-running &#8216;If&#8230;&#8217; (1981). As of the 2010s the controversial cartoonist has brutally depicted both British and international politics for almost four decades now. His work has often been victim of censorship and occasionally irritated thin-skinned politicians.</p>
<p>He was born in 1951 in Walthamstow and studied art at the Teesside College of Art, graduating in this discipline and film making at Leeds University in 1974.<br />
Among his influences are Leslie Illingworth, Trog (Wally Fawkes), James Gillray, William Hogarth, George Cruikshank, David Low, Ronald Searle, E.C. Segar, Leo Baxendale and Robert Crumb.<br />
Three years after his graduation, he became an art teacher in Birmingham, but quit after only a year because the job was not what he expected from it.<br />
Encouraged by his girlfriend, he tried out cartooning. He was rejected by The Beano, but still impressed enough to preserve their rejection letter.<br />
His first comic strip, &#8216;Maxwell the Mutant: Marauding the Midlands&#8217; was published in the alternative paper Birmingham Broadside in 1977. It featured a story about a man able to mutate in whoever he wanted. His rival, Neville Worthyboss, was a thinly veiled caricature of the head of the local city council, Neville Bosworth.</p>
<p>Thanks to a cartoonist friend, Kipper Williams, Bell found work at the magazine WHOOPEE!, where he published the short-lived comic strip &#8216;Dick Doobie the Back to Front Man&#8217; (1978). His strip &#8216;Gremlins&#8217; appeared in the first issue of the magazine JACKPOT. While he enjoyed making children&#8217;s comics he was more drawn to making political work.<br />
With the election of Margaret Thatcher as Prime Minister in 1979, he had more than enough reasons to become more socially conscious. When Time Out looked for a cartoonist who could attack Thatcher&#8217;s administration, Bell gave them the satirical comic strip &#8216;Maggie&#8217;s Farm&#8217; (1979), whose title was both a nod to Thatcher as well as the Bob Dylan song of the same name. The strip meant his breakthrough and was later transferred to City Limits magazine.<br />
Other projects he made around 1980 were the comic strip &#8216;Lord God Almighty&#8217; for The Leveller and a cartoony adaptation of the song &#8216;Ivan Meets G.I. Joe&#8217; by The Clash, which can be read inside the sleeve of their album &#8216;Sandinista!&#8217;. Another graphic artist who once collaborated with The Clash was Derek Boshier.</p>
<p>Bell&#8217;s best-known comic strip is &#8216;If&#8230;&#8217;, which has been running in The Guardian since 2 November 1981 and was named after Rudyard Kipling&#8217;s iconic poem. The satirical gag strip only took off during the Falklands War (1982), when Bell got the idea to move the action of his stories to the Falkland Islands. Most episodes center around a socialist marine officer, Reginald Kipling, and a talking penguin who shares more conservative and capitalist ideas. Over the course of decades, storylines mirrored current events and had frequent unflattering cameos of real-life politicians, such as Thatcher, Ronald Reagan, Khomeini, Henry Kissinger and George Bush Sr. and Jr.<br />
Apart from &#8216;If&#8230;&#8217; Bell also publishes one-panel cartoons, which forces him to reach two deadlines a day. His interest in politics is such that he often visits political party conferences to see his targets in real life. He claims it often inspired him spotting small details in their features which he didn&#8217;t notice in photographs or news footage, such as &#8220;Prime Minister Tony Blair&#8217;s psychotic glint in his eye&#8221;. He also enjoys referencing famous classical paintings in his cartoons.<br />
Bell has also published in CHEEKY, Private Eye, New Society, Leveller, Social Work Today, NME, The Journalist and The New Statesman. The latter magazine fired him in 1999 after handing in a cover drawing depicting Tony Blair&#8217;s brain in a food-processor.<br />
Steve Bell was voted Humorous Strip Cartoonist of the Year 1984 and was honored with the same title by the British Press Awards in 2003. Together with Bob Godfrey, he made the animated cartoon series, &#8216;Margaret Thatcher &#8211; Where Am I Now?&#8217; (1999) for Channel 4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sidney-william-burgon.jpg"><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-54845 aligncenter" src="https://britishcomics.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/sidney-william-burgon.jpg?w=332&#038;h=307" alt="" width="332" height="307" /></a></p>
<p>SIDNEY WILLIAM BURGON learned the elements of sketching from his mother. Burgon became a mechanic, while continuing to draw. It were his cowerkers in a local garage who finally pushed him to further exploit his artistic talent. After some first cartoons for The Weekly News (published under the pseudonym Swab), Burgon gave up his dayjob and began freelancing as a cartoonist in 1963. His cartoons appeared in several dailies and weeklies.</p>
<p>It was 1970 when Burgon sent his first comic to the editor of Whizzer &amp; Chips. Burgon stayed briefly at Whizzer: a year later he went to Knockout, for which he created the successful &#8216;Joker&#8217; feature. In his later series, he brought forth several monster characters, such as &#8216;The Invisible Monster&#8217; and &#8216;The Little Monsters&#8217;. Burgon also worked on &#8216;The Toffs and the Toughs&#8217; (in Whizzer), &#8221;Milly O&#8217;Nare and the Penny Less&#8217; (in Jackpot), &#8216;Ivor Lott and Tony Broke&#8217; (in Buster) and &#8216;Lolly Pop&#8217; (in Whoopee), among others.</p>
