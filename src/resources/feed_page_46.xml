<p>I&#8217;m very sorry to hear of the passing of the artist JAMES HANSEN (often known as Jimmy Hansen) who died on Tuesday 19th June 2018.</p>
<p>In a career spanning more than 40 years, Jimmy Hansen drew thousands of pages for British comics, working on strips such as The Bumpkin Billionaires, Ricky Rainbow, P5, a stint on Dennis the Menace, and Buster amongst others. He was the cover artist on Buster for the last several years of the comic, bringing a great sense of energy and fun to the strip, as he did with all his pages.<br />
Some of his early work was The Winners&#8230;Crybaby Jackpot&#8230; the Skateboard squad Cheeky comic<br />
He said his first comic work was for whizzer and chips Hot Rod the dragon&#8230;must of been for a summer special&#8230; my guess he started mid 70&#8217;s at Fleetway..<br />
Apparently he was only in his late 60s. Gone far too soon.</p>

<p>Jack Clayton drew for Cheeky, Jackpot and Buster comic.</p>
<p>He did the wonderful joke page Hit the Jackpot!</p>
<p>Where so much detail was put in the backgrounds…that sometimes the backgrounds were funnier than the jokes.</p>
<p>He liked drawing little mice (Mickey types), cats, dogs and snails …small animals.</p>
<p>He was also great at drawing the over reaction the groan from a character. Almost falling backwards. Paddywack had this effect a lot.</p>
<p>His first work was in Cheeky late 70’s where the kids recreate a scene for there home video.</p>
<p>You can see how the kids did it with home made props and costumes. Again lots of funny details.</p>
<p>Paddywack came later in Cheeky and even became when the comics merged the cover star of Whoopee!!.</p>
<p>Jack Clayton is an artist from East London who has spent the last four years travelling.</p>
<p>His inspiration for his art work is drawn from his experiences around the world and a representation of his environment.</p>
<p>Jack Clayton was the artist of Paddywack. Irish cartoon character that was supposed to be drawn by Doodle Doug that use to bribe Cheeky to see his work or tell his Dad about his comics.</p>

<p>IAN KNOX (born 4 May 1943, Belfast, Northern Ireland) is a political cartoonist for the Irish News, and also drew cartoons for the BBC Northern Ireland political show Hearts and Minds.<br />
Knox trained as an architect at Edinburgh College of Art (1963–67) and Heriot-Watt University (1967-68), and worked as an architect before establishing himself as a cartoonist. He worked in animation from 1970 to 1975 for Halas &amp; Batchelor in London, Potterton Productions in Montreal, and Kotopoulis Productions in Toronto. He then joined Red Weekly and Socialist Challenge as a political cartoonist, as well as contributing to various children&#8217;s comics for IPC from 1975-88.<br />
In the 1970s and 80s he drew various humour strips for IPC comics, including &#8220;Dreamy Den&#8221;, &#8220;Strawbelly&#8221; and &#8220;Terror TV&#8221; for Buster, &#8220;Major Jump, Horror Hunter&#8221; for Monster Fun, &#8220;The Krazy Gang&#8221; and &#8220;Pongalongapongo&#8221; for Krazy, &#8220;Funtastic Journey&#8221; and &#8220;6 Million Dollar Gran&#8221; for Cheeky, &#8220;Lucky Dick&#8221;, &#8220;Winnie the Royal Nag&#8221;, &#8220;Starr&#8217;s Wars&#8221; and &#8220;Grim Gym&#8221; for Whizzer and Chips, &#8220;Gran&#8217;s Gang&#8221; for Whoopee!, and &#8220;Exercises&#8221; and &#8220;Roger Rental&#8221; for Oink.<br />
He signed much of his political work &#8220;Blotski&#8221;, and he and Republican News cartoonist Cormac worked together as &#8220;Kormski&#8221;, drawing the anti-clerical strip &#8220;Dog Collars&#8221; for Fortnight Magazine. Since 1989 he has been the editorial cartoonist for The Irish News, a nationalist newspaper based in Belfast. Since 1996 he has contributed the &#8220;As I See It&#8221; feature to Hearts and Minds on BBC2 Northern Ireland. From 1997-98 he was political cartoonist for Ireland on Sunday.<br />
Knox has cited Ronald Searle, Low, John Glashan, Vicky, Steve Bell, Pat Oliphant and Charles Addams among those who have influenced him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IAN KNOX</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve got the issue right, victims don&#8217;t generally criticise you&#8221;<br />
For 25 years he has shown that the artist’s pen can be mightier than the sword, by challenging paramilitary and state violence, while remorselessly mocking the hypocrisy and corruption of the powerful.<br />
While the impact of Ian Knox’s penmanship may petrify even the most hardened politician, the artist himself cuts an almost shy figure.<br />
Born in south Belfast in 1943 he quickly immersed himself in a lifelong fascination with cartoons and later satire.<br />
“I can never remember a time when I wasn’t obsessed with drawing, particularly comics,” he said, in an interview with The Detail.<br />
“The Beano was the one I wanted, but my mother had come home from New York and thought Disney was better, so I was the only one person who occasionally got Mickey Mouse comics.<br />
“Everyone else wanted to read it. I wanted to read the DC Thompson comics which were far more anarchic and far more interesting I thought.<br />
“In comics terms I was a Brit but everyone else were Americans.”<br />
After studying architecture in Edinburgh for five years Knox started his professional career in London in 1968.</p>
<p>However he quickly became frustrated with the “soul destroying” monotony of life as a draftsman and eventually sought out salvation in the unlikely location of one of the capital’s more notorious hotspots.<br />
“I went around Soho Square which I was told was the centre of the animation industry to a pub called the Dog &amp; Duck, which is where I heard where animators hung out.<br />
“I saw two guys that looked in my impression what animators might be and I approached them and they were.<br />
“They told me the animation companies to try and eventually I talked my way in.”<br />
For the next five years he worked as an animator in London and Canada but quickly realised once again that he had not yet found his artistic niche.<br />
Throughout the late 1970s he worked for a combination of socialist magazines and children’s comics.<br />
Knox attributes his interest in left wing politics to a Scottish history teacher, Archie Douglas.<br />
“He didn’t actually bother much with the teaching. He just handed us out bound volumes of Punch from the 19th Century.<br />
“It’s easier actually to get a 19th Century volume of Punch than it is to get a 20th Century volume. They are much rarer than the 1950s when Ronald Searle, Antonia Yeoman and all those fantastic artists were drawing.<br />
“They had marvellous pen technique; there was vibrancy and malice.<br />
“It wasn’t as wild as James Gillray and Thomas Rowlandson from the 18th Century, but it was still great stuff.”</p>
<p>In 1989 the Irish News’ then acting editor Terry McLaughlin agreed to allow Knox to work as a weekly cartoonist.<br />
“I started doing cartoons for the Irish News on Saturdays and then eventually persuaded them to let me do it for the rest of the week.”<br />
For the next 25 years Knox, adopting the pseudonym ‘Blotski’, used the power of his cartoonist’s pen to satirise the hypocrisy and double standards of countless public figures.<br />
Ian Knox&#8217;s take on finding a replacement for Nuala O&#8217;Loan as Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland<br />
But how did he deal with the sensitivities of the latest atrocities and the pain of grieving families?<br />
“It always hovering behind my shoulder. But it didn’t need to, because the kind of cartoon I did dealt with issues.<br />
“If you’ve got the issue right, victims don’t generally criticise you. They want the truth. They did then and they still do. The truth is more important than anything else to them.<br />
“If you’ve got it right, even if it’s horrible, the victims don’t object.<br />
“I never shrank from any issue. The day I have to shrink from an issue I’ll pack it in.”<br />
Through the Troubles ‘Blotski’ had one self-imposed rule which he refused to waiver or compromise on.<br />
“The big guiding thing for me is anti-violence.<br />
“Violence I think is the worst sin there is. I’m not religious, but nothing else comes near to violence.<br />
“I mean fraud or anything is nothing like violence, there is no need for violence unless the only way to save your life is to use force.<br />
“I was very suspicious of any violent action. I still am and that’s the one guiding thing for me – violence is wrong.”<br />
He dismisses any suggestion that his role as a cartoonist was unique in that he was constantly under pressure to be topical and had to push the boundaries by challenging paramilitaries over the latest atrocity or politicians over the next political bun fight.<br />
“Everybody in journalism was dealing with it (pressure). What I like is the realpolitik, to try and find out what is the motive of the person doing it and why are they being thoroughly dishonest and doing something atrocious for reasons which are quite false. My job is to show that up, really that’s it.”<br />
Despite having publicly ridiculed virtually every well known Northern Ireland politician at one time or another, he says that very few of his subjects ever criticised his work.<br />
“Hardly ever at all. I mean they may be seething quietly, but most people are far too polite to say anything, and never by victims, I’ve never been criticised by victims.<br />
“Funnily enough all the political flack started flying after the Troubles and the atrocities stopped.<br />
“Cartoons about financial things and such like have produced far more writs than any act of violence.&#8221;<br />
He added: “I’ve never been to court in my life. I look forward to it when it happens.”<br />
Knox remains his own worst critic, insisting that his early cartoons “weren’t very funny”.<br />
“They are much better now, even if the situation is grim.<br />
“If you can be funny about the issue the point gets over much better.<br />
“Now, whatever the issue is, I try to make it look slightly funny.<br />
“I think New York Jewish humour is very good like that and Glaswegian humour, grim but funny.”<br />
Has his work become harder and issues now more difficult to find since the ceasefires and the establishment of the Stormont Assembly?<br />
“It’s much easier, far easier. I’ve got the whole world now. I don’t have to deal with something awful. It’s 1,000 times better.<br />
“Bread and butter politics are basically real politics.<br />
“It’s so depressing that people, like the dissidents, want to use violence.<br />
“They think it’s okay to use violence but inside their heads, what are they at?&#8221;<br />
He said they should be constantly challenged: “They should be hauled before a television camera. Of course they wouldn’t come, but they should be made to justify what they’re doing or to try and explain.”<br />
But in today’s age of wireless broadband and instant demand for news, is the cartoon still relevant in 2014?</p>
<p>“I think it is. It’s been going for centuries. Satire should be analytical, it’s not fiction. It should be about the truth.”<br />
When asked if he has ever been threatened for his work he is matter of fact in his reply: “Not really.”<br />
He remains conscious that fellow artists in other parts of the world have not been so fortunate.<br />
“In 1993 as the Soviet Regime was collapsing in Russia, the creators of Spitting Image, Peter Fluck and Roger Law, tried to take satire to Moscow. It was all ready to be set up but one of the directors was assassinated the night before it went out. That was a warning and it never happened.<br />
“There are Palestinian cartoonists in Israel. People who do decide to make it truth (are at risk). I am very fortunate here. I did a series recently here about the fantastic life, about Lord Castlereagh and people who were prepared to put their necks above the parapet in those days didn’t last very long. I’m living in fortunate times comparatively.”<br />
But is the pen mightier than sword?<br />
“I’ve never tried the sword. Certainly it’s the sword of my choice. It certainly gets to a lot more people.”<br />
With a wistful grin Knox admits that there is an inner devil constantly striving to challenge and subvert the accepted norm.<br />
“I love shoving my views down other people’s throats, but it’s much better if you slip it in without people realising it.<br />
“It’s safer for me as well.”</p>
<p>Ian Knox</p>

Hopefully the above info helps…<br />

So many of those old IPC pages were destroyed or sold off, so it’s good to know those Cat Girl pages are with someone who deserves them.</p>

<p>FRANK MINNITT (3 September 1894 &#8211; 12 May 1958) was a comic artist for the publications of D.C. Thomson and Amalgamated Press, and is best known for his work on the &#8216;Billly Bunter&#8217; comic. During World War I, Minnitt served in the Coldstream Guards in France, where he suffered injuries from mustard gas. After the war, he held several jobs, before turning to an artistic profession. A completely self-taught cartoonist, Minnitt began to freelance joke drawings to newspapers. By 1927 he had successfully taken over several other artists&#8217; strips, and his work was published in AP comics like Butterfly, Comic Life, Joker, Merry &amp; Bright, Jolly and Sparkler.</p>
<p>In 1930, Minnitt tried his luck with DC Thomson, drawing &#8216;Peter Pranky&#8217;, &#8216;Smiler Smutt&#8217; and &#8216;Jimmy and Jumbo&#8217; for Adventure Comics. He also drew for the Fun Section of the Sunday Post, and The Dandy. At AP, he contributed &#8216;Stainless Stephen&#8217; and &#8216;Will Hay&#8217; to Pilot. He later drew among others &#8216;Kiddo the Boy King&#8217;, &#8216;Bob&#8217;s Your Uncle&#8217; and &#8216;Merry Margie the Invisible Mender&#8217;.</p>
<p>These strips became so popular that Minnitt was asked to take over the &#8216;Billy Bunter&#8217; strip the Knockout comic in 1939. This strip made Minnitt&#8217;s reputation, and was drawn by him until shortly before his death in 1958. His other serials for Knockout included &#8216;Merry Marjie&#8217;, &#8216;Kiddo the Boy King&#8217; and &#8216;Ali Barber&#8217;. After World War II, he worked for several publishers on short-lived titles like Comicolour, Jingo Comic, Swell Comic and Big Laugh. In the final years of his career, several AP editors didn&#8217;t care for Minnitt&#8217;s old-fashioned style, and he found himself out of work, except for the &#8216;Billy Bunter&#8217; comic.</p>

<p>FRANK McDIARMID was a British, originally from Glasgow, comics artist best known for his work on Roger the Dodger in the Beano and on IPC humour titles such as Whizzer and Chips, Cheeky Weekly, Krazy Comic, Whoopee!, Wow! and Monster Fun. Strips he drew include Cheeky (for which he created an extensive supporting cast including Lily Pop, Yikky Boo!, Baker&#8217;s Boy and Constable Chuckle), Kid Kong, Boy Boss, Frankie Stein and Willie Bunk. He has since moved into the field of fine art.</p>
<p>I worked first of Dc Thomsons, who were responsible for the Beano and Dandy, they were masive. They had some great talent working there. I spent my time from 1955-1966 working for them. The first strip of any consequence I worked on was following on from Ken Reid at the Dandy, it was a story called &#8216;Big Head and Thick Head&#8217;, from 1962-1966. I followed in the footsteps of many well known artists Douglas Phillips, who drew &#8216;I flew with Braddock&#8217; and Fred Sturrock who was well known for his Illustrations.<br />
At the same time as working on Comic Characters back then, I also managed to get into the straight art market, in titles such as Rover, Hotspur, Wizard and Adventure, spy stories for Thomsons then&#8230; in those days there was a block illustration followed by two or three pages of prose. I did quite a few covers in those Boys papers.</p>
<p>Working at Thomsons the mentality was that it a job for life, and if you stayed with them you&#8217;d never need to work for anyone else. But I had to spread my wings, I knew there was so much more I could do&#8230;<br />
So after eleven years I got a bit restless, and asked if I could work at home, which quite a few artists did. They gave me that short shrift, and said they prefer the idea to come from them.<br />
I decided to go to London with some samples in my Spring holiday, just to see what the response was. In those days, Fleetway were just taking off with a whole stable of comics, and they loved what they saw. They gave me every encouragement and they had a lots of work for me.<br />
The fleetway comics covered all sorts of titles &#8230; Lion, Tiger, Valiant, and the funnies such as Wham, Pow, Buster and eventually Whoopee and Whizzer and Chips&#8230;<br />
I became a freelance artist, and in 1973 did Roger the Dodger. I worked on a lot of Characters through the years. I did four years of Texas Kid in TV Comic and a year and a half on Eagle in the early 1970&#8217;s. I worked on Boy Boss, Mustapha Million, Chruncher, The Gasworks Gang, Frankie Stein, and war comics such as Battle and many others.<br />
But I am best remembered for Cheeky. I came on the scene when Cheeky was singled out for stardom. Bob Paynter, fleetway&#8217;s Group Editor asked me to do it. Bob&#8217;s idea when Cheeky emerged was that they&#8217;d use as much as my stuff as they could, seven pages a week.<br />
Bob said I should drop Roger and concentrate on working for them. I said no. I had worked hard and I didn&#8217;t have to put all my eggs in one basket. This overlapped the Cheeky period, and occasionally artists would stand in for me. At least two thirds of Cheeky was drawn by me.<br />
It was hard to have a favourite character. There was Posh Claude, Lilly Pop. They were all dear to me. My favourite strip was Cheeky by a mile, we were encouraged to be anarchic and mild. I still can draw most of the characters from memory &#8230; and there was a lot of them!<br />
There also was the Snail. That was my idea. I was given a free hand &#8211; in fact was encouraged to come up with this stuff. Those characters Bubble Gum Boy, Libby, Disco Kid, Auntie Daisy and Walter Wurx. They were all good fun!<br />
Who came up with the Jokes? In the strips he was referred to as Willie Cook, but in fact he was a character from Thomsons &#8211; full name of Gordon Cook &#8211; he came up with all the bad bones. I was in charge of coming up with all the scenes and things that were going on, the rubbish written in between-anything that would make it look different.<br />
The pages were one and half sizes bigger than the comic, and was mechanically reduced down in London. The strips were drawn in pencil and then inked &#8211; but given the pressure of the work I was given a free hand and to go straight ahead, there was no requirement to show them. The Captions and Speech Bubbles was done down there by whoever. I never really did find out who did them. it was weird drawing a strip without seeing the text Bubbles! But what is weirder: I only met Bob Paynter about three times in my life. And yet he was the fountain head for all this nonsense that I was producing and having a great time!<br />
I felt gloriously happy at the time seeing my work on display in newsagents up and down the country!<br />
Ha Ha! Cheeky was my favourite to work on &#8211; a particular pleasure to draw because of the freedom I was given, I still have a slim volume of fan mail from back then.<br />
I had my own art gallery in Arbroath when I started to work from home until 2000.</p>

<p>FRANCISCO S0LANO LOPEZ (26th October 1928-12th August 2011) was a comics artist from Buenos Aires, Argentina, who entered the field in 1953 with the series Perico Guillerma. Acknowledged as one of the most influential Argentinian comic artists (at one point, he had to flee to Spain in order to avoid arrest, as his series El Eternauta touched on Argentina&#8217;s volatile political situation), he also worked extensively for Britain&#8217;s Fleetway comics such as Valiant, Buster, Smash!, Knockout (IPC), Score &#8216;n&#8217; Roar, New Eagle and Lion, on strips including Adam Eterno, Kelly&#8217;s Eye, Janus Stark, Master of the Marsh, Nipper, Pete&#8217;s Pocket Army, Jet-Ace Logan, The Drowned World, Battler Britton and Galaxus: The Thing from Outer Space. In the 1990s he branched out into the field of erotic comics, proving that his range really was pretty much unlimited.</p>
